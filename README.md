# ‚ö†Ô∏è Please don't link to this repository

We understand you want to help people run An Anime Game on Linux. The issue is, the more people know
of the tools involved in it, the higher the chances The Anime Game Company will notice them, and then
fix the flaws that let us do the needful.

While sharing in your self-managed chat services and through private messaging is fine, we humbly ask
that you refrain from publically sharing links to this repository, or to any of the tools involved.

Or share them and ruin it for the dozens of Linux players. It's up to you.

## If you're going to share it anyway

Do what you must, but we would respectfully request that you try to label the game as "The Honkers Railway Game"
instead of the actual name of the game, to avoid search engine parsing.

# üöß Project status

Due to lack of interest from my side the project stays in a legacy, maintaining-only state for a long period of time. This project will not receive huge updates unless really necessary. I still keep it up to date with latest changes in the game and work with community to solve the issues, but old-known unessential bugs will not be fixed, and new features will not be added. Instead, I'm working on other projects, and the future is in uniting all the launchers in one single [universal launcher](https://github.com/an-anime-team/anime-games-launcher). This project stays in "proof of concept" stage right now and requires major changes, which, again, require interest from my side. Keep your eye on our discord server for more details.

# ‚¨áÔ∏è Download

Launcher developer does not provide any packages for this programm. Instead, we almost fully rely on other people to maintain them.

To see the installation guides, please visit [this wiki page](https://github.com/an-anime-team/the-honkers-railway-launcher/wiki/Installation).

Instructions may be outdated due to lack of interest in maintaining them. You can help the project by keeping documentation up to date if you're interested in it.

## üòë Third party support

These packages are supported by third party distributors. They either did not contact us, or contact exceptionally rarely. We do not verify state of these packages, and we are not related to their state at all.

| Format | Source | Distributions |
| - | - | - |
| DEB | [the-honkers-railway-launcher](https://launchpad.net/~thundergemios10/+archive/ubuntu/the-honkers-railway-launcher) | Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Pop!_OS |
| Pacstall | [the-honkers-railway-launcher-bin](https://pacstall.dev/packages/the-honkers-railway-launcher-bin) | Ubuntu |

## Chinese version support

This should be automatically enabled if you're using `zh_cn` (Chinese) as your system language. If you're not using it - you can change the game edition in the launcher settings.

The main problem, though, is that github is blocked in China, and it's used in other parts of the launcher - not just in game edition. Notably, you can't use the same components index as other people do.

To fix this, you have to make your own copy of the [components](https://github.com/an-anime-team/components) repository and change all the links there from github releases to some mirror. Later you can update the components index repo link in your launcher's `config.json` file.

If you have any questions - feel free to contact the dev in our discord server (or if you have no way to use discord - try sending me an email, but it's unlikely to be received).
